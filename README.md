# Mars Rover Simulation
[This project](https://github.com/TravelHX/digital-b2c-interview-kata) is a TypeScript implementation of a Mars Rover simulation. The simulation allows for multiple rovers to be placed on a plateau and navigated using a series of instructions.

## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, you can use the following command:

npm start

This will compile the TypeScript code and run the `index.ts` file, which contains the test input and the code that runs the simulation. The final positions of the rovers will be printed to the console.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the following command:

npm test

This will run the Jest test runner and execute the test cases. The results of the tests will be printed to the console.

## Future Enhancements

This project is a work in progress, and there are several potential enhancements that could be made in the future. Some possible enhancements include:

* Data visualization: Adding a graphical representation of the plateau and the rovers could make the simulation more engaging and easier to understand.
* Input validation: Adding validation to the input form could help to prevent errors and unexpected behavior from occurring during the simulation.
* Additional features: Adding additional features, such as the ability to add obstacles to the plateau or to simulate rover communication, could make the simulation more realistic and useful.
